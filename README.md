# QtCookBook
This repository contains example of usage of PySide6.

Most of the examples are the examples from `Mark Summerfield`'s book : `Rapid GUI Programming with Python and Qt`

Those examples have been modified here to convert them to PySide6 (instead of PyQt4 in the original book) and to reflect the changes in API design between those 2 versions of the Qt framework in python.

The book's home page, where any corrections will be published, and from where the examples and exercise solutions can be downloaded, is http://www.qtrac.eu/pyqtbook.html.

The remaining files are examples and wip projects to use the Qt gui framework (in its Python form) with unittests in order to test GUI interactions in an automated manner.
